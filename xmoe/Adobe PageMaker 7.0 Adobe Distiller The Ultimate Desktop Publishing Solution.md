Adobe PageMaker 7.0 is a powerful desktop publishing software that allows you to create professional-quality documents for print and digital media. One of the features of PageMaker 7.0 is the ability to create PDF files that can be viewed on any device with Adobe Acrobat Reader. PDF files are ideal for sharing your documents with others, as they preserve the layout, fonts, graphics, and hyperlinks of your original file.
 
To create PDF files with PageMaker 7.0, you need to install Adobe Distiller, a software that converts PostScript files to PDF files. Distiller is included in the PageMaker 7.0 application CD, but you can also download the latest version from Adobe's website[^2^]. You also need to install the Adobe PostScript printer driver, which is part of the standard Windows XP installation or can be downloaded from Adobe's website[^2^].

In this article, we will show you how to create PDF files with PageMaker 7.0 and Adobe Distiller in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Open your document in PageMaker 7.0
 
Launch PageMaker 7.0 and open the document you want to convert to PDF. You can also create a new document from scratch or use one of the templates provided by PageMaker 7.0.
 
## Step 2: Select the Adobe PDF settings file
 
In PageMaker 7.0, go to File > Print and select "Generic PostScript Printer" as the printer name. Click on "Properties" and then on "Advanced". In the "PostScript Options" section, select an Adobe PDF settings file from the "Default Settings" pop-up menu. The Adobe PDF settings file determines the quality and size of your PDF file, as well as other options such as security and fonts. You can choose from several predefined settings or create your own custom settings[^1^].
 
## Step 3: Print your document to a PostScript file
 
Click on "OK" to close the "Advanced" window and then on "OK" again to close the "Properties" window. In the "Print" window, click on "Print to File" and choose a location and a name for your PostScript file. Click on "Save" and wait for PageMaker 7.0 to generate the PostScript file.
 
## Step 4: Convert your PostScript file to a PDF file with Adobe Distiller
 
Launch Adobe Distiller and select an Adobe PDF settings file from the "Default Settings" pop-up menu (you can use the same one you used in PageMaker 7.0 or a different one). Drag and drop your PostScript file from the desktop to the Acrobat Distiller window or click on File > Open and browse for your PostScript file. Distiller will start converting your PostScript file to a PDF file and display the progress in the status window[^1^]. When the conversion is done, you will see a message saying "Job completed successfully".
 
## Step 5: View your PDF file
 
You can open your PDF file with Adobe Acrobat Reader or any other PDF viewer software. You can also view your PDF file in a web browser by dragging and dropping it to a browser window or by uploading it to a web server. Your PDF file will look exactly like your original document in PageMaker 7.0, with all the layout, fonts, graphics, and hyperlinks intact.
 
## Conclusion
 
Creating PDF files with PageMaker 7.0 and Adobe Distiller is a simple and effective way to share your documents with others without compromising their quality or compatibility. You can use this method for any type of document you create with PageMaker 7.0, such as newsletters, brochures, flyers, catalogs, reports, etc. By using PDF files, you can ensure that your documents will be viewed as you intended them on any device with Adobe Acrobat Reader.
