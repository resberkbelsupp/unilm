In this article, we will show you how to use a service called BuildStore that allows you to install apps outside the App Store on non-jailbroken iOS devices. BuildStore is a paid service that costs $14.99 per year, but it offers a wide range of apps that are not available on the App Store, such as emulators, screen recorders, torrent clients, hacked games and more. BuildStore uses Apple's own app distribution methods for beta testing and enterprise apps, so it does not require jailbreak or any modifications to your device.
