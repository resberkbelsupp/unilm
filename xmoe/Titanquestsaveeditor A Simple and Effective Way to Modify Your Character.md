A save editor is a tool that allows you to modify your save file and alter various values in your character. There are several save editors available for Titan Quest, but some of them may not work with the latest version of the game or its expansions. In this article, we will introduce you to a new Titan Quest AE Save Editor that works with the Anniversary Edition and the Ragnarok and Atlantis DLCs.
 
## What is Titan Quest AE Save Editor?
 
Titan Quest AE Save Editor is a simple and open source tool that was created by Reddit user \_demilich. It allows you to edit the following values in your save file:
 
- Character name
- Gold
- Unspent attribute points
- Unspent skill points
- Death counter

This is nothing ground breaking, you can do all of that with a hex editor already. But maybe some people don't want to bother that or are just too lazy ;) In that case, feel free to give it a try[^2^].
 
## How to Use Titan Quest AE Save Editor?
 
To use Titan Quest AE Save Editor, you will need to download it from Github[^2^]. You can choose between two options: a zip file that contains an executable for Windows, or a jar file that can run on any OS with Java installed. You only need one of the two files.
 
Before you use the save editor, make sure you backup your save file or folder in case something goes wrong. You can find your save file in the following location:
 `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\Titan Quest - Immortal Throne\SaveData\Main\<charactername>` 
Once you have backed up your save file, you can launch the save editor and select your character file. It should have a .chr extension. Then you can modify any of the values you want and click on Save Changes. You can also click on Reset Values to restore the original values.
 
After you have saved your changes, you can close the save editor and launch Titan Quest. You should see your modified character in the game. Enjoy!
