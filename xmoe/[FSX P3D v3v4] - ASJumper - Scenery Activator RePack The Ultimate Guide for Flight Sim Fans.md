ASJumper is a simple and lightweight tool that allows you to activate scenery in FSX and P3D v3/v4 with just one click. It works by creating symbolic links between your scenery folders and your simulators, so you don't have to copy or move files around. You can also use it to deactivate scenery when you don't need it, saving disk space and improving performance.
 
To use ASJumper, you need to download the latest version from [here](https://www.flightsim.com/vbfs/fslib.php?searchid=83158376) and unzip it to a folder of your choice. Then, run the ASJumper.exe file and follow these steps:
 
1. Select the simulator you want to activate scenery for (FSX or P3D v3/v4).
2. Select the scenery folder you want to activate (for example, C:\ASJumper\Scenery\Orbx).
3. Click on the "Activate" button and wait for the process to finish.
4. Launch your simulator and enjoy your scenery.

To deactivate scenery, simply follow the same steps but click on the "Deactivate" button instead. You can also use the "Check" button to see which scenery folders are currently active or inactive.
 
ASJumper is a handy tool for flight simulator enthusiasts who want to enjoy different scenery without hassle. It is compatible with FSX and P3D v3/v4, and supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. However, it is not compatible with P3D v5 or higher, and it does not work with encrypted or protected scenery files. Use it at your own risk and always backup your files before using it.
