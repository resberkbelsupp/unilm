- **Voxel-based gaseous fluid dynamics:** TurbulenceFD 2018 for Cinema4D uses a voxel grid to store the state of the fluid. This allows for high-resolution simulations that capture the details and complexity of fluid motion. You can also adjust the voxel size and resolution to optimize the performance and quality of your simulation.
- **Physically-based fire shader:** TurbulenceFD 2018 for Cinema4D has a fire shader that calculates the color and intensity of the fire based on its temperature and density. This results in realistic flames that react to the environment and light sources. You can also control the appearance of the fire by adjusting parameters such as fuel, oxygen, smoke, and glow.
- **Particle advection:** TurbulenceFD 2018 for Cinema4D can advect particles along with the fluid motion. This means that you can use particles to add extra detail and variation to your simulation. For example, you can use particles to create sparks, embers, debris, or dust.
- **Multiple scattering:** TurbulenceFD 2018 for Cinema4D supports multiple scattering, which is a phenomenon where light bounces off multiple particles in the fluid. This creates a soft and natural look for your simulation. You can also adjust the amount of scattering and absorption to achieve different effects.
