However, Sakura's happiness is interrupted by a mysterious force that starts to erase objects and people from Tomoeda. She discovers that it is caused by the Nothing Card, the 53rd and final card created by Clow Reed, the original master of the Clow Cards. The Nothing Card has the power to erase anything it touches, and it wants to take away all the Sakura Cards from Sakura.
