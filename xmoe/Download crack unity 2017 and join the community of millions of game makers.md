## Step 5: Explore the features of Unity 2017
 
Unity 2017 offers a lot of features and improvements that can help you create amazing games and interactive experiences. Here are some of the highlights:
 
- **Timeline Editor**: A powerful tool for creating cinematic sequences, cutscenes, gameplay events, and more. You can use it to arrange animations, sounds, effects, and scripts on a timeline and blend them together. You can also use it with Cinemachine, a suite of camera tools that lets you create dynamic and procedural cameras without coding[^2^].
- **Post-Processing Stack**: A new way to enhance the look and feel of your project with effects such as bloom, color grading, depth of field, and more. This new version offers improved effects and a complete framework for custom effects. It also comes with a volume-based blending feature, so you can define areas in the scene and set up specific looks when the player enters them. Unity will automatically blend between volumes to allow for smooth look transitions[^2^].
- **2D Sprite Atlas**: A new asset that replaces the Sprite Packer and gives you more control on how to pack sprites and use them at runtime. You can create atlases from folders or collections of sprites, assign them to groups with different settings, and manage them with scripts. You can also use Sprite Masks to mask sprites in world space using the new SpriteMask component[^2^].
- **Animation Improvements**: Unity 2017 introduces several improvements to the animation system, such as support for integer and enum animation, manual keyframing workflow, separate recording and preview modes in the Animation Window, contextual menus for animatable properties in the inspector, and a new GameObjectRecorder class for recording game object changes[^2^] [^4^].
- **Scripting Improvements**: Unity 2017 adds support for assembly definition files, which allow you to define your own managed assemblies based on scripts inside a folder. This can greatly reduce script compilation times in the Editor. It also adds support for C# 6.0 features, such as null-conditional operators, string interpolation, expression-bodied members, and more[^2^] [^4^].
